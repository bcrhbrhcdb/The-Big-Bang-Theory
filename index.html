        <h3>What is The Big Bang Theory?</h3>
        <p class="align-left index-text"> 
            According to the Big Bang Theory, the universe started as a single, dense, endlessly hot point, called the <a href="html/vocab.html#singularity">Singularity</a> that expanded and stretched over 13.7 billion years. The expansion is visible to astronomers through the cosmic microwave background. Some theorists provide alternate explanations, such as perpetual inflation or an oscillating universe, but the majority accept the idea.

        <h3>How do we know The Big Bang happened? </h3>
        <p class="align-left index-text">
            Scientists have discovered that distant galaxies are accelerating away from our Milky Way, a phenomenon attributed to a cataclysmic event similar to the Big Bang. This discovery highlights the intricate interplay of cosmic forces that have shaped the universe over billions of years. As scientists explore this galactic motion, they aim to unravel the underlying mechanisms and physical laws, broadening our understanding of the cosmos and revealing the beauty and complexity of the universe.
